      <description>&amp;ldquo;STOP PAYING FOR IELTS PREPARATION AND LEARN FROM IELTS OWN STAFF&amp;rdquo;
Its completely out of my understanding why people spend money to prepare for IELTS.
I see a lot of people confused and worried about where should they prepare for IELTS test.
Some take classes on-campus while some join skype sessions and pay large sum of cash for these services.
I just want everyone to know that there is a free self-paced online course available on the internet which is designed by the academics of University of Queensland.</description>
