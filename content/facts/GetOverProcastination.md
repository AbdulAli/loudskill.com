**Good news for lazy people to avoid scams and agent fees.**

Tremendous amount of people out there have zero motivation to put an effort yet they need a scholarship. The good news is that now there is a solution to this. Now you can get fully funded masters in Canada, Germany and US within 2 months for just 3 Lac Pakistani rupees (all visa and tickets inclusive).

The key point here is that you need to pay these 3 lac rupees to none other than yourself.

For the first month pay yourself 1 lac rupees on the basis of which you'll have to work 40 hours a week. In the first week you'll google "a lot" and list down 10 universities that are offering funding based Masters without GRE and to which you meet their eligibility requirements as well. For rest of the three weeks you prepare for IELTS.

For the second month, you pay yourself 1 lac rupees again and on the basis of which you'll work 40 hours a week again and apply to the shortlisted universities.

Rest of the one lac you'll have to pay for application fees i.e. around Rs. 10,000 per university.

Now the 2 lacs which you earned by working for the first two months, you can spend that money on visa and tickets.

Best of luck!
