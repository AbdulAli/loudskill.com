**"STOP PAYING FOR IELTS PREPARATION AND LEARN FROM IELTS OWN STAFF"**

Its completely out of my understanding why people spend money to prepare for IELTS.

I see a lot of people confused and worried about where should they prepare for IELTS test.

Some take classes on-campus while some join skype sessions and pay large sum of cash for these services.

I just want everyone to know that there is a free self-paced online course available on the internet which is designed by the academics of University of Queensland.

This innovative preparation course has been designed and written by experienced English teaching professionals from The University of Queensland, an IELTS testing centre and one of the world’s leading centers of learning. All of the course writers have extensive experience enabling students to reach their academic IELTS goal of entering a university where English is the primary language.

Now whats the point of paying money and learning from someone who has no official association with IELTS test centre.

P.S Those who are looking for IELTS General module please know the fact that Academic is always more difficult. So it's advised that you first take this course and then buy one book of IELTS 9 10 OR 11 and prepare from it for general test. There is just a minor difference only in the writing module which you would know from the book.

For those who are asking about the mock exam. Well you can buy a simple IELTS book IELTS 9, IELTS 10 or IELTS 11. It comes with a CD and you can conduct your own exam at home.

Website link added for mock tests. جزاءک اللہ

Please note that if you cant prepare it by yourself and you want someone to spoon feed you i.e. in an academy/coaching/tuition, you'll never be able to get good marks at exam. How can you expect that a local guy can teach better than the faculty of Queensland and those people who work at IELTS?
