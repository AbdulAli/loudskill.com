**6 powerful things for BS MS and Ph.D students in Pakistan that we are not doing and we should do!**

1. Apply for International Summer Internships

Most of the top universities and research institutes in Europe and North america offer summer internships to undergraduate and masters students. Mostly these internships completely cover you expenses. During this internship, you'll have to complete a research project under the supervision of a professor. Its a great chance to prove your worth, enhance your CV, do research at a renowned institute, and gain international exposure.

2. Apply for student exchange program

Various international intitutes offer an exchange program in which you get to study and spend one semester at that university, where you study various elective courses out of your choice. You get international exposure and improve your soft skills.

3. Poster Presentations

Young researchers should present their ideas and initials research findings at local conferences within Pakitsan. Your research doesn't always have to be a journal paper. Start with a poster! You get a chance to have early feedback and also potential collaborations.

4. Research Collaborations

This is really important. Why to look for a potential supervisor within your university whrn there are millions of professors out there? Reach out to professors early in your degree, email them, discuss your interests, seek potential collaboration. Ask if they can co-supervise you, or maybe just collaborate with you on a research project. Then talk to your local supervisor and they'll happily agree for collaboration. The second best part is that you don't have to worry about travel grants anymore, the foreign prof will do that for you. And the first best part is that you'll get his name on your thesis, on your research article and on your CV. You get their recommendations and you can even start a Ph.D with them if you really impressed them during the course of your degree in Pakistan.

5. Summer Schools

A lot of international conferemces or specific research group communities offer fully funded summer schools in which their focus is to mentor students. Give them a perspective of what kind of research is being condicted in their area, how they can find a thesis topuc, how they can build a research network and more importantly how you can improve your soft skills.

6. Volunteer at conferences

Perks of volunteering is that you get partial funding, you get to meet and greet your favourite researchers in person. You get to attend the whole research confernece and get new ideas and directions for your research. You also get to find new potential collaborations.
