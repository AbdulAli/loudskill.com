      <description>Canada is accepting more than ever!
&amp;ldquo;This is even for my friends already studying in Europe, East Asia, Australia, and United States&amp;rdquo;
After securing admission, or even before that, apply for Canadian PR instead of Study Permit if you&amp;rsquo;re under 31.
 Advantages:   You just have to secure admission in any university and then you can come without visa.
 Your tuition fees will be half as compared to study visa holder.</description>

      <title>Don&#39;t Confuse the Professor</title>

      <description>I feel like a lot of people misunderstood my previous post about searching for a Ph.D. scholarship in Canada.
The purpose of contacting a supervisor is to ask them to supervise your Ph.D. thesis. When someone asks a professor for a Ph.D admission instead of supervision it not just confuses the professor but also their response is generic i.e. Apply directly to the university.
If you asked a professor for admission and they advised you to apply directly to the department that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean in any sense that the professor is willing to support your application.</description>

      <description>A lot of people ping professors but never hear back.
First I will mention some important steps and then the structure of a perfect email that you can write to a professor.
Step.no.1: First of all, read the requirements of admission at the department&amp;rsquo;s website. Remember that unlike Pakistan, each department of a university has their own requirements.
If the requirements are clear then proceed to Step.no.2
Step.no.2: Go to professors personal website and search for the section of future students, prospective student or any such kind of thing.</description>
