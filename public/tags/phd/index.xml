      <description>Canada is accepting more than ever!
&amp;ldquo;This is even for my friends already studying in Europe, East Asia, Australia, and United States&amp;rdquo;
After securing admission, or even before that, apply for Canadian PR instead of Study Permit if you&amp;rsquo;re under 31.
 Advantages:   You just have to secure admission in any university and then you can come without visa.
 Your tuition fees will be half as compared to study visa holder.</description>
